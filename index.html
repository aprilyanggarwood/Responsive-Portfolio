                      My name is April. I have a lot of sales, customer service,
                      and marketing work experience with my priviouse and
                      current jobs both in China and America. My work
                      experiences have taught me to ask questions and pay
                      attention to detail, as these are really important for
                      people to succeed in their career.

                      Humility, teamwork, and curiosity are my strengths in both
                      my professional and educational career. I believe that
                      everyone around me could be my teacher/mentor in my life
                      and career.

                      Currently, I am pursuing a certificate in a full stack
                      web-development at University of Washington. I am
                      motivating myself to learn computer coding skills because
                      there are more job opportunities in this job field, and my
                      interest and curiosity brought me into this field. I love
                      to keep my skills up to date in order to better fit this
                      new technologic world.

                      Today, as we know, more and more people love/need to use
                      the web or mobile applications to do more things at their
                      convenience. Therefore, my goals in my future tech career
                      are to help companies to create and develop easy-to-use
                      applications based on company and userâ€™s needs in order to
                      build an online channel for both sides to efficiently
                      interact and communicate 24/7.
