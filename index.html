              My name is April. Yes, I was born in April which was in spring season, a beautiful season to start a new year according to the Chinese lunar year calendar. Yes, I came from China. My native language is Chinese Madeiran. I love to travel and learn different cultures. I am a skinny girl, but I can eat a lot when I travel to different countries and places for trying the local delicious food. I recommended that you must to try the local street food if possible that will give you a fresh experience when you travel. Also I love to visit the local bakery and coffee stores to start my day when I travel. I have more than 20 scarf in my scarf collection, most of them are gotten when I was in traveling. My favorite color is yellow. My favorite flower is yellow roses.
