## Summary-and-usage-of-this-application

- My portfolio which comes with three pages by applying the reponsive layout with Bootstrap CSS framework, and each page is effectively linked and active.

- I created three HTML files and one CSS file: `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, `contact.html` and `style1.css` to complete this application. Each page contains three sections: `Navbar`, `Main`, and `Footer`.

  - `index.html` is the About Me page. This page contains my name and the linked manual "Contact Portfolio About" in the Navbar. My picture and my bio are located in the About Me container area, and my picture is designed to be a reponsive image when the width of screen in large, medium, and small size. My [resume](./Assets/AprilResumeforschool.pdf), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ying-april-yang-a9bb8720/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/aprilyanggarwood?tab=repositories) are all with a link which is able to take you to a PDF file or a new browser window. Footer is fixed to the bottom of the page.

  - `portfolio.html` is the Portfolio page. This page contains the consistent Navbar and Footer design from index.html file, as well as the two columns of the group of card containers are set into the portfolio container. The two columns of the card group are created by using the responsive `.row-cols-* class` and `.img-fluid class` which set columns to be responsived to the screen size from large size with two columns to small size with one column.

    - Each card container contains the name and the demo gif of the project. The name of the project with an link which will take you to a new browser window along with the GitHub repository of the project. The demo gif of the project also with an link which will take you to a new browser window along with the GitHub page of the project.

  - `contact.html` is the Contact page. This page contains the consistent Navbar and Footer design from index.html file as well as a form-group with Name ,Email and Message in the contact container area. A Submit button is located under the Message form. On the top right of the contact container, my resume, Linkedin, GitHub repository, and my contact email are all deplayed as an icon along with a link which will take you to a PDF file or a new browser window when you click on the icon.

- All the meanwhile, I utilized the Inspect Tool to check and modify the elements and selectors which are applied to the HTML and CSS files. Fortunately, the CSS file is functionally working well to build each HTML file.
