# 02 CSS and Bootstrap: Create A Responsive Portfolio

This homework practice is to create an application with responsive layout design for rendering the solution well on a variety of devices or screen sizes. Screenshots referencing an existing application are provided in the Assets/Images folder.

## Summary of this application from [HW2](https://aprilyanggarwood.github.io/UW-Coding-Boot-Camp---HW2/)

- This application is my portfolio which comes with three pages by applying the reponsive layout with Bootstrap CSS framework, and each page is effectively linked and active.

- I created three HTML files and one CSS file: index.html,portfolio.html, contact.html and Style1.css to complete this application.

- Each page contains three sections: Navbar, Main, and Footer. Container is located in the main section which took two thirds width of the screen.

  - index.html is the About Me page. This page contains my name and the linked manual "Contact Portfolio About" in the Navbar. My picture and my bio are located in the container area. The contact link of my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ying-april-yang-a9bb8720/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/aprilyanggarwood?tab=repositories) are added in the last paragraph of my bio.Footer is fixed to the bottom of the page.

  - portfolio.html is the Portfolio page. This page contains the consistent Navbar and Footer design from index.html file, and the five images in the container area are into the responsive behavior when the width of screen runs to a different screen size. The columns of images in the container will be changing from two columns to one column when the width of screen size changes from large to medium.

  - contact.html is the Contact page. This page contains the consistent Navbar and Footer design from index.html file as well as a form-group: Name form, Email form, and Message form which took five sixths of the width of the container area in one column. A Submit button is located under the Message form.

- All the meanwhile, I utilized the Inspect Tool to modify and adjust the declarations for each selector applied to the HTML file. The CSS file is functionally working well to build each HTML file.

Finally, my practice work looks similar to the reference pictures which we have in the Image folder.
